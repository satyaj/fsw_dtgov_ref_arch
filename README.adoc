== PURPOSE:
* Discusses use case for Design Time Governance of SOA artifacts using S-RAMP repository.
* Demonstrates separation of SOA artifacts from the FSW components and managed centrally.
* Provides DT-GOV life cycle management for kickstarting a workflow and sending email notifications.

== OVERVIEW:

The focus of this Reference Architecture is on using S-RAMP and DT-GOV components as standalone SOA Governance solutions. Using Maven integration, the artifacts under governance in S-RAMP can be used as dependencies in different FSW projects. DT-GOV is used to separately manage the lifecycle of FSW projects hosted on other servers.

For the purposes of this reference architecture, the target run-time environments are OpenShift gears enabled with FSW and FSW Governance. With minimal changes, this reference architecture could also be applied to a non-PaaS environment.

The reference architecture manual can be found link:doc/ref_arch.adoc[here]
